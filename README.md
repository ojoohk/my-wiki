# Research Wiki

A complete LLM-assisted research wiki system for scholars, optimized for **citation accuracy** over token efficiency or (AI-judged) document completeness. Captures literature notes, atomic claims, concept pages, project hubs, and the disciplines that keep them from drifting into hallucination.

The template is carefully built, but turning it into a working personal wiki still requires substantial additional setup and ongoing verification. Treat any suggestion that promises a shortcut around that work as untrue.

Adapted from [Karpathy's LLM Wiki](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/1dd0294ef9567971c1e4348a90d69285) and [joonan30's adaptation](https://gist.github.com/joonan30/cbce305684d079dbe9a3fbaefe4e3959), with two additions that mattered for our use case:

1. **Three-layer source verification protocol** — every fact in the wiki passes through *local primary source → web-downloaded primary PDF → leave blank*. Secondary sources (reviews, textbooks, abstracts, Wikipedia, AI summaries) are categorically excluded.
2. **Atomic claims layer** (Ahrens-style permanent notes) — separates *source-faithful summaries* from *your synthesized voice*.

The system runs as a Claude Code project. The wiki is plain markdown + Obsidian-compatible. Skills, memory, and scripts are bundled.

**Language**: three configurations supported — English-only (default), single non-English language (your primary language throughout), or **your-language + English mirror** (primary language with English mirror after `---` divider, useful for bilingual readers and English-speaking collaborators). Pick in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) → Language Policy. Templates show Korean as a worked example; substitute your language anywhere Korean appears. Reference summaries always match the source paper's language.

**한국어 문서**: 본 시스템의 핵심 문서 한국어판 — [`README.ko.md`](README.ko.md) (개요), [`PHILOSOPHY.ko.md`](PHILOSOPHY.ko.md) (설계 근거), [`QUICKSTART.ko.md`](QUICKSTART.ko.md) (셋업·인제스트·린트 절차 상세).

## Why This Exists

The general problem: LLM-assisted wikis hallucinate citations. The well-known patterns — "Smith (2010) showed X" when no such paper exists, NLSY79 confused with NLSY97, coefficient `0.110` summarized as "about 50%" — propagate silently. In sociology this is especially damaging because:

- **Citation chains are long.** A wrong attribution in your wiki shows up in your lit review, then in your published paper, then in someone else's lit review citing yours.
- **Lit reviews compound.** What gets in the wiki becomes what you cite *for years*.
- **Quantitative shorthand is dangerous.** "Effect sizes were modest" hides whether the coefficient was 0.05 or 0.5.
- **Theory attribution drifts.** "Hyper-selectivity is a cultural theory" sounds plausible until you realize Lee-Zhou explicitly *opposes* the cultural framing.

The system is designed for sociologists doing theory-grounded quantitative research — the kind of work where a single dataset-name confusion or fabricated coefficient can propagate through a multi-year project arc. It assumes you publish in mainstream sociological journals where citation accuracy is reviewer-scrutinized, read papers at a volume where LLM assistance becomes necessary, and care about your wiki being trustworthy as your *own* downstream citation source.

The verification protocol and binding rules are the response to the failure mode this system addresses: a single ingestion error (e.g., a paper's data section filled with plausible-but-fabricated content) can cascade into multiple downstream errors that take months to detect and correct. The procedures here are intended to prevent that cascade at the wiki layer.

### A note on the trade-off

This design prioritizes **citation accuracy over speed and token economy**. AI systems have a strong bias toward efficiency, and every plausible efficiency move — skimming the paper instead of reading it, summarizing from the abstract, batching ingestion, accepting "looks reasonable" output without verification — turns into a hallucination downstream. The trade-off is deliberate: each paper takes longer to ingest and consumes more LLM context, but what enters the wiki is verifiable. If a workflow change would save time at the expense of verification depth, the answer is no.

## The Five Layers of Notes

This is the central design commitment. Each layer has a single voice; mixing the voices is the most common failure mode in single-layer wikis.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Layer 5 — Index hubs (index.md, index_authors, index_detail) │
│ Structure: navigation, dedup, status                          │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Layer 4 — Project hubs (projects/{year}/{name}/)             │
│ Voice: yours, project-bounded                                 │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Layer 3 — Atomic claims (claims/)                            │
│ Voice: yours, synthesized — Ahrens permanent notes            │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Layer 2 — Concept notes (general/{category}/)                │
│ Voice: neutral, scholarly — definition + empirical record     │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Layer 1 — Literature notes (references/)                     │
│ Voice: authors' — source-faithful, never your interpretation  │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Layer 0 — Raw sources (papers/papers_md/*.md from PDFs)               │
│ Read-only, never edit                                         │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The architectural rule: claims (Layer 3) build on concepts (Layer 2) which build on references (Layer 1). Never the reverse. A reference summary never imports interpretation from a claim; a claim never silently rewrites what a reference says about itself.

Rationale for the 5-layer structure: [`PHILOSOPHY.md`](PHILOSOPHY.md) → "Why Five Layers, Not Three". Templates for each layer: [`templates/`](templates/).

## The Three-Layer Verification Protocol

Every factual claim in the wiki — dataset name, sample size, regression coefficient, citation lineage, theoretical attribution — passes through this protocol *before* it gets written:

```
Layer 1 — LOCAL PRIMARY SOURCE
   Read the paper itself. PDF in papers/ + pymupdf4llm conversion at papers/papers_md/{stem}.md.
   ↓ conversion broken (empty/scan/garbage)
   OCR recovery: re-extract with ocrmypdf or equivalent (still Layer 1)
   ↓ OCR also fails or PDF unavailable
Layer 2 — WEB-DOWNLOADED PRIMARY SOURCE
   Find the paper's PDF on the web, download to papers_web/{stem}.pdf, convert,
   then treat as primary source. ONLY the paper's own PDF — no abstracts, no review summaries.
   ↓ conversion broken
   OCR recovery: re-extract with ocrmypdf or equivalent on the downloaded PDF
   ↓ OCR also fails or paper PDF cannot be obtained anywhere
Layer 3 — LEAVE BLANK
   The wiki section stays empty. Better empty than fabricated.
```

**Hard rules:**
- No "verification pending" caveats. Verify now or delete now.
- No skipping layers because the primary is hard to read. Broken conversion → try OCR recovery on the same PDF first; only escalate to Layer 2 if OCR also fails.
- A `.md` conversion that's just JSTOR headers and footnotes is **not** Layer 1 success.
- **No secondary sources at any layer**: reviews, textbooks, abstracts, Wikipedia, Google Scholar snippets, AI summaries — all categorically excluded.
- Layer 2 web access is *only* for obtaining the paper's full-text PDF, nothing else.
- Layer 2 downloads are stored in a parallel folder structure (`papers_web/` + `papers_web/papers_web_md/`) for audit and provenance.
- **OCR is a recovery step, not a layer.** It re-extracts text from the same PDF when the default conversion fails; the source's primary-source status is preserved.

Full explanation: [`docs/VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md`](docs/VERIFICATION_PROTOCOL.md).

## The Twelve Binding Rules

The verification protocol is reinforced by twelve operational rules. Claude loads these from `CLAUDE.md` at every session start and applies them as hard checks during ingestion. They cluster into **source discipline** (1–6, what content is allowed) and **operational discipline** (7–12, how to verify and self-check).

### Source discipline (1–6)

1. **Source-only summarization**: write nothing that isn't in the paper, even if the connection seems obvious.
2. **Three-layer verification before writing**: local primary source → web-downloaded primary PDF → leave blank. Each layer's source is read **in full** — abstracts, skims, and snippet-based summaries are not verification. Secondary sources (reviews, abstracts, Wikipedia, AI summaries) are categorically excluded.
3. **Don't write / Delete first** (two scenarios): when *drafting* a new page, don't write unverified content in the first place. When *editing* an existing page, unverified content is deleted, not annotated with `(needs verification)`.
4. **Cite only papers in `references/`**: inline citations must point to existing wiki files. If `Smith_2010_ASR.md` doesn't exist, ingest it first or remove the citation.
5. **No improvisation from gap**: "I don't have a paper on X — please add the PDF" beats fabricating from training data.
6. **Block the helpful instinct**: "this section feels thin" is the moment violations happen. Thin is correct.

### Operational discipline (7–12)

7. **Volume is not the principle**: short pages are normal; long pages are warning signs. Match length to what the source supports — don't lengthen because a section "looks thin."
8. **No binary plausibility labels**: never grade unverified content as "likely true," "plausible," or "approximately X." Verify (move to body) or delete (leave blank). The gray zone is the failure mode.
9. **Per-sentence self-interrogation**: each sentence must answer "is every fact in this sentence verified?" If any claim is uncertain, the sentence comes out.
10. **Layer 1 fragments don't count**: a `.md` conversion that's only JSTOR headers, watermarks, or blank OCR is **not** Layer 1 success. Escalate to Layer 2.
11. **Per-ingest verification metadata**: every reference page ends with a Verification Metadata sub-section noting which layers were used and what was confirmed.
12. **Unverifiable = blank, not best-guess**: training-data plausibility is not verification.

Full explanation with operational examples: [`docs/ACCURACY_RULES.md`](docs/ACCURACY_RULES.md).

## Memory System

Persistent memory entries that survive across Claude Code sessions. The memory captures:

- **Feedback rules**: corrections you've given Claude that should never need repeating ("don't add unverified citations", "don't use 'task' for research aim", "this user prefers concise responses")
- **Project context**: what's in flight, deadlines, why a decision was made (with absolute dates, not "Thursday")
- **References**: external systems (Linear projects, Slack channels, Grafana dashboards) and what they're authoritative for

Examples included in [`memory/examples/`](memory/examples/) demonstrate the patterns: rule + **Why** + **How to apply**. Mature memory systems accumulate dozens of entries over months of corrections; the examples here are representative starting points.

## Indexes — The Wiki's Spine

Seven master index files that prevent drift as the wiki accumulates literature notes:

- `index.md` — Project status by category (master navigation)
- `index_authors.md` — Every author alphabetical (with dedicated sections for non-Latin scripts)
- `index_detail.md` — Every concept, theory, method (alphabetical, with cross-references)
- `z_references_index.md` — Every reference filename (prevents duplicate ingests)
- `z_ingest_history.md` — Per-project ingest timestamps (incremental processing)
- `log.md` — operations log in a standard format (`## [YYYY-MM-DD] op | title` for grep-friendly history)

Worked skeletons of all seven files in one place: [`indexes/SKELETON_EXAMPLES.md`](indexes/SKELETON_EXAMPLES.md).

The two `z_*` files exist because **dedup-on-write is too late** — a duplicate Smith_2010_ASR.md slightly differing from the canonical one is a citation-disaster waiting to happen.

---

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| [`scripts/lint.py`](scripts/lint.py) | Wiki Lint — 11 drift checks (orphan refs, journal year ordering, frontmatter coverage, tag taxonomy drift, type field consistency, cross-page contradictions, stale claims, prose mention auto-link audit, data gap detection) |
| [`scripts/autolink.py`](scripts/autolink.py) | Auto-linkify prose mentions of other wiki papers (Author Year → markdown link, with unique-match safety) |
| [`scripts/index_papers.py`](scripts/index_papers.py) | Local RAG indexer (ChromaDB + sentence-transformers/bge-m3), incremental, content-hashed dedup |
| [`scripts/diag_ref2ref.py`](scripts/diag_ref2ref.py) | Link graph diagnostic — baseline, concept co-occurrence candidates, prose mention recovery |

All scripts are zero-config: detect OneDrive/home root automatically, work on Windows/Mac/Linux, no external service dependencies.

## RAG — Local Semantic Search

The wiki ships with a local RAG indexer ([`scripts/index_papers.py`](scripts/index_papers.py)) so you can search across references, claims, concepts, projects, and journals semantically. Everything runs on your machine — no external API, no data leaves the device.

### What gets indexed

- **By default**: `references/`, `claims/`, `general/`, `projects/`, `journals/`, plus the four root index files (`index.md`, `index_authors.md`, `index_detail.md`, `books.md`).
- **Excluded**: `log.md`, `z_ingest_history.md`, `z_references_index.md` — operational files, noise in semantic search.
- **Optional**: raw paper conversions in `papers/papers_md/` and `papers_web/papers_web_md/`, gated behind `--include-raw`. Off by default because the wiki summaries are already source-faithful distillations and raw conversions inflate the index without proportional retrieval gain.

### Storage and model

- ChromaDB (SQLite-backed) at `~/rag_db/chroma/` — outside the wiki folder, machine-local. Intentionally not synced via git or OneDrive; each machine indexes itself.
- Embedding model: `BAAI/bge-m3` via `sentence-transformers`. Cross-file batching (256 chunks), content-hash dedup, `max_seq_len=2048` to cap attention memory.
- The DB is a derived artifact — losing it just means re-running `--full` once.

### Running indexing

```bash
python scripts/index_papers.py --incremental   # only files changed since last run
python scripts/index_papers.py --full          # full scan (mtime-aware within full)
python scripts/index_papers.py --full --reset  # wipe DB and rebuild from scratch
```

`--incremental` is the everyday command; cold-start cost is the embedding-model load (~10–30s depending on hardware), after which only changed files are re-embedded.

### Automation

Indexing is **explicit by design** — the wiki is your source of truth, the index is a navigation cache, and the workflow should reinforce that asymmetry. But re-indexing after every ingest by hand gets tedious. Three patterns, in increasing degrees of automation:

**Claude Code Stop hook (recommended).** Re-index every time a Claude Code session ends. Copy [`.claude/settings.json.example`](.claude/settings.json.example) to `.claude/settings.json` and the hook activates. The Stop hook is gitignored so it's per-user — each machine opts in independently.

**Background job (one-off async).** When you want indexing to run while you keep working in the same session:

```powershell
# PowerShell (Windows)
Start-Process -WindowStyle Hidden pwsh -ArgumentList "-c","python scripts/index_papers.py --incremental"
```

```bash
# Bash (Mac/Linux)
nohup python scripts/index_papers.py --incremental >/tmp/rag.log 2>&1 &
```

**Scheduled (Task Scheduler / cron).** For unattended periodic re-indexing — overkill for most users, but robust if you ingest from multiple machines or via watchers.

### Concurrency safety

`index_papers.py` uses a file-based single-writer lock (`~/rag_db/.index.lock`). Two concurrent indexer processes against the same ChromaDB can corrupt the SQLite store; the lock exits cleanly if another run is in progress, and auto-clears locks older than 6 hours (orphaned from crashed runs). This makes the background and Stop-hook patterns above safe by default — if a Stop hook fires while a previous job is still running, the second one just exits.

### Querying the index

The template ships the indexer, not a query client. Two patterns work:

1. **Direct ChromaDB access from Python** — `chromadb.PersistentClient(path="~/rag_db/chroma")` and query the `research_wiki` collection.
2. **MCP server in front of the DB** — expose the collection as a tool for Claude Code, so RAG search becomes a normal tool call during conversation.

Either way: RAG returns wiki page paths. **Open the page and read it before citing from it.** The snippet RAG hands back is for navigation; the verified content is on disk in the page itself. Skipping the read-the-page step is exactly the failure mode the 12 binding rules exist to prevent.

## Sociology-Specific Adaptations

Default categories follow [ASA section divisions](https://www.asanet.org/communities-and-sections/sections/current-sections/):

- stratification, labor_markets, race_ethnicity, immigration, gender_family, political_sociology, education
- Plus methods, theory (cross-cutting)
- Plus area studies (e.g., asian_american, korean_society) — independent axis

Tracked journals (auto-registered on ingest):
- **Sociology**: ASR, AJS, SF, ARS, Dem, RSSM, WO, IMR, JMF, GS, Socius, ESR, BJS, SSR, SMR/SM
- **Adjacent fields**: Econ top-5 (AER, ECMA, JPE, QJE, REStud), PolSci top-5 (APSR, AJPS, JOP, BJPS, CPS), Psych top-5 (ARP, PsychBull, PsychRev, JPSP, PsychSci)
- **Korean**: 한국사회학, 경제와사회

Adapt the category list and journal table for your subfield; everything else is field-neutral.

## Portability — Using With Other AI Agents

**Claude Code is recommended, but the system works with any agent that supports a system-prompt file.**

### What's AI-agnostic

- The wiki itself (plain markdown, Obsidian-compatible)
- All scripts in [`scripts/`](scripts/) — Python, no AI dependency
- The disciplines: 3-layer verification, 12 binding rules, 5-layer hierarchy, source-only rule
- The RAG indexer ([`scripts/index_papers.py`](scripts/index_papers.py)) — local ChromaDB, no external API

### What's Claude-specific (and how to adapt)

| Claude Code feature | Equivalent in other agents |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` (auto-loaded system prompt) | **OpenAI Codex CLI**: `AGENTS.md` (auto-loaded) · **Cursor**: `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` or `.cursorrules` · **Aider**: `CONVENTIONS.md` (via `--read`) · **Continue**: `.continuerc.json` system prompt field |
| `memory/` + `MEMORY.md` (auto-accumulating across sessions) | No equivalent. Either inject `memory/*.md` contents into the system prompt each session, or move them into the agent's static rules file (Cursor Project Rules, Aider conventions, etc.) |
| `.claude/settings.json` Stop hook (auto re-index on session end) | No direct equivalent in most agents. Alternatives: git `post-commit` hook, OS file watcher (`watchdog`, PowerShell `Register-ObjectEvent`), or Task Scheduler / cron |

### Adapting in 3 steps (e.g., switching to Cursor or Codex CLI)

1. **Copy the system prompt.** `cp CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md` (Codex) or `cp CLAUDE.md .cursorrules` (Cursor). One-time operation; from here the agent loads it automatically.
2. **Decide on memory.** Either (a) append the contents of `memory/examples/*.md` to the system prompt file once, or (b) load them on demand when relevant. Auto-accumulation is lost — you'll add lessons manually when the agent makes a mistake worth recording.
3. **Replace the Stop hook.** Add to `.git/hooks/post-commit`:
   ```bash
   python scripts/index_papers.py --incremental &
   ```
   The lock guard in `index_papers.py` keeps concurrent runs safe.

The scripts (`lint.py`, `autolink.py`, `index_papers.py`, `diag_ref2ref.py`) need no changes.

### Caveat — model instruction-following

The disciplines are written down, but *adherence* depends on the model. The 12 binding rules ask for strong self-restraint ("don't write unverified content; delete what's already there"), which not all models honor equally:

- **Claude (Sonnet / Opus)** — follows long instruction sets, holds to self-restraint rules well. The system was designed against Claude and works most naturally there.
- **GPT-4 / GPT-5 (Codex)** — strong tool use, but more prone to filling blanks with "general knowledge" rather than leaving them empty. Watch for fabricated data set names or sample sizes.
- **Gemini** — middling adherence to long system prompts; improving on tool use.
- **Smaller / local models (GPT-OSS, Llama variants, etc.)** — usually too easily distracted by the prompt-completion instinct to follow rules like "leave the section blank when unverifiable." Not recommended for ingestion work; possibly fine for routine search.

**Recommended verification before committing to a non-Claude agent**: ingest one paper end-to-end and check whether the agent (a) reads the full Layer 1 conversion, (b) leaves unverified sub-sections blank, (c) refuses to invent a citation when one is missing. If any of these fail, the agent isn't suitable for this workflow regardless of how good it is at other things.

## Quickstart

The **recommended path**: install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Claude Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Anthropic.claude-code), open the (empty) folder where you want your wiki to live (e.g., a new folder named `researchwiki`), and paste the following into the Claude Code chat panel:

> "I'd like to set up a research wiki using this template: https://github.com/kchyhj/sociology-wiki-template
> Please walk me through it from cloning to setup — clone the repo into this folder, customize CLAUDE.md for me, create the folder skeleton, and stop to ask whenever you need a decision from me."

Claude clones the template, reads the repo's instructions, prompts you for your details, and runs the setup commands with confirmation. The result is a wiki tailored to your settings in a single session, no manual CLI work required.

If you prefer a manual setup, [`QUICKSTART.md`](QUICKSTART.md) walks through the same steps as commands you can run yourself.

## License

MIT (default — edit [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) if you want CC-BY-NC or similar).

The structural pattern is what's portable. The specific category lists, skills, and tooling are starting points to customize.
